# ThumbnailDL

Android application that saves Youtube video thumbnails. For now, functionality is very basic. (no enlarged image view, infinite scrolling, ugly, etc.)

#### Todo list:

* Endless list
* Larger image preview
* Prettier theme
* Handling intents from Youtube application
* Application icon
* Better name?
